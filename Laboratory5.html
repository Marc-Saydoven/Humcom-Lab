    "You may not always want to win an <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/honest" target="_blank">honest</a> election just like you don't always win court cases on the
    merits. The magic word is <a href="https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/logistics.shtml" target="_blank">logistic</a> or dirty money." How do you raise the magic word? "Simple," he said.
    "your supporters cum contractors who must be waiting in the wings by now for the investment payback
    should start transacting good business. They will suggest that government procures, through them,
    garden tools, farm implements, certified seeds and fertilizers, for distribution to chosen constituents. Or it
    can be fire extinguishers, medicines, medical/dental supplies, radio communication equipment,
    computers, the list is endless. Depending on some paper work or documents, and trusted subordinates,
    ghost deliveries can be made." "There must always be a ROPI (return of political investment) for FR (future reference)." Or words to that effect.

        They have come to adopt a view of corruption as a generic social problem, effectively <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095721556#:~:text=In%20sociology%2C%20a%20process%20associated,Dictionary%20of%20Media%20and%20Communication%20%C2%BB">disembedding</a>
        it from society. 
        These developments have enabled a more intolerant approach such that, today, 
        the greater danger lies in an anticorruption <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/fundamentalism">"fundamentalism"</a> leading to the rejection of politics altogether. 
        Viewed as a whole, the history of corruption/anticorruption has been a popular struggle over what politics should look like,
        and thus we might read their dialectic as driving the progress of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/political-modernization" target="_blank">political modernization</a> from below.

    The Philippines has spent an estimated 545 billion pesos ($9.6 billion) for thousands of flood mitigation projects in the last three years. 
    The projects were under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/government" target="_blank">government</a> review to determine which ones are substandard or <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonexistent" target="_blank">non-existent</a> as Marcos said he has found during inspections he led in flood-prone provinces in recent weeks.
